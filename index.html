    <h1>Profile</h1>
    <p>
        Last academic year I was at Durham University studying mathematics. I made the decision to leave the University after completing two terms having realised that the course wasn’t for me after all. However I thoroughly enjoyed the programming module.<br> Since then, I have continued learning to code and program using online courses and resources, mainly Codecademy on which I’ve completed a python course and am working through the “Full-Stack Engineer” career path. I’ve been exposed to html, css, javascript and c also.
